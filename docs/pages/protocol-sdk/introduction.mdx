## Protocol SDK

The Zora Protocol SDK is a typescript package that simplifies interacting with the Zora protocol by generating required transactions for our contracts.

### Installation

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @zoralabs/protocol-sdk viem@2.x

```

### Usage

The Zora Protocol SDK contains both a Creator Client and a Collector Client. The Creator Client is used to 
create and manage Zora creator 1155 contracts and tokens, while the Collector Client is used to mint 
Zora creator 1155, 721, and premints.

```ts twoslash
import { useChainId, usePublicClient } from 'wagmi';
import { 
  createCreatorClient, 
  createCollectorClient } from "@zoralabs/protocol-sdk";

// get the current chain id and PublicClient using wagmi
const chainId = useChainId();
const publicClient = usePublicClient();

const creatorClient = createCreatorClient({ chainId, publicClient });
// @noErrors
creatorClient.
//            ^|




const collectorClient = createCollectorClient({ chainId, publicClient });
// @noErrors
collectorClient.m
//               ^|



```
