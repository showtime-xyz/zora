## Deploying to a new chain

Deploy the [ProxyDeployer](src/DeterministicUUPSProxyDeployer.sol):

```sh
forge script script/DeployProxyDeployer.s.sol {rest of deployment config}
```

Add an empty address.json in `addresses/${chainId}.json`

Deploy the mints manager implementation, which will update the above created addresses.json with the new implementation address and version:

```sh
forge script script/DeployMintsManagerImpl.s.sol {rest of deployment config}
```

Deploy the `ZoraMintsManager`, which when initialized will deploy the `ZoraMints1155` contract:

```sh
yarn tsx scripts/deployMintsDeterminisitic.ts {chain-name}
```

To verify that deployed proxy contract, run the printed out verification command from the above step.
