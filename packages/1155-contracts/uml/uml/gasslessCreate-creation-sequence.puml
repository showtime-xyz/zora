Group New premint token on new contract
  
  Creator -> CreateUI: setup NEW contract name + image
  activate CreateUI
  CreateUI -> PremintContract: get deterministic collection address\nfor contract creation params
  activate PremintContract
  PremintContract --> CreateUI: deterministic collection address
  deactivate CreateUI
  deactivate PremintContract

end

Group New premint token on existing premint contract

  Creator -> CreatePage: load page by deterministic collection address 
  CreatePage -> SignatureAPI: load collection creation params
  SignatureAPI -> SignatureDB: fetch collection creation params\nby hash
  SignatureAPI --> CreatePage: contract creation params

end

Creator -> CreatePage: setup new token
CreatePage -> PremintContract: get deterministic collection address
PremintContract --> CreatePage: deterministic collection address
CreatePage -> SignatureAPI: get new uid for collection address
SignatureAPI -> SignatureDB: get next token uid\nscoped to collection address
SignatureDB --> SignatureAPI: next token uid
SignatureAPI --> CreatePage: next token uid
Creator -> CreatePage: Submit new token creation params
CreatePage -> Creator: request signature of\n contract + token creation params + token uid 
deactivate CreatePage
Creator -> SignatureAPI: Submit signature + contract + token params + token uid
SignatureAPI -> PremintContract: validate signature
PremintContract --> SignatureAPI: validation results (true/false & recovered signer)

Group Signature is valid
  PremintAPI -> PremintAPI: store premint and signature
